# FluentFix UI Enhancement Summary

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. Tailwind CSS Configuration
- **Problem**: Custom color classes like `from-primary-600` were not recognized
- **Solution**: Created proper `tailwind.config.js` with custom color palette

- **Solution**: Moved color definitions to Tailwind config and kept animation variables in CSS
