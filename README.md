This project is an AI-powered speech correction and language learning platform designed to help children and adults improve their pronunciation and speaking skills.

Through interactive exercises, learners can listen to words, practice pronouncing them, and receive instant feedback powered by artificial intelligence.

Each letter (in Arabic) includes five progressive levels, guiding users from basic pronunciation to mastery.
If the pronunciation is correct, the learner automatically advances to the next level — creating a fun and engaging learning experience.

The platform combines:

🎯 Django for building a robust and scalable backend.

⚛️ React.js for creating an interactive, responsive front-end experience.

🐳 Docker for containerization and easy deployment.

My role in this project was to develop the front-end interfaces using React.js, connecting them to the Django API and ensuring a smooth user experience across all stages.
